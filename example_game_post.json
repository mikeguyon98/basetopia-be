  "content": "# Game Summary\n\n**Date:** 2024-02-22  \n**Status:** Final  \n**Venue:** Peoria Stadium  \n**Away Team:** Los Angeles Dodgers  \n**Home Team:** San Diego Padres  \n**Away Score:** 14  \n**Home Score:** 1  \n**Winning Pitcher:** Gavin Stone  \n**Losing Pitcher:** Joe Musgrove  \n**Save:** None  \n\nIn a one-sided affair at Peoria Stadium, the Los Angeles Dodgers showcased their offensive firepower, demolishing the San Diego Padres 14-1. The onslaught began in the first inning when the Dodgers brought home eight runs, setting a daunting pace that the Padres struggled to match. \n\nTop performers included Chris Owings, whose consistent batting provided a backbone for the Dodgers' attack, and Jake Cronenworth, who managed to put the Padres on the board with a solo home run. Kevin Padlo's two-run homer and Teoscar Hernández's two-run double were among the standout moments that ensured the Dodgers' victory was never in doubt. \n\nGavin Stone, the winning pitcher, was in fine form, striking out key players like Fernando Tatis Jr., while Yuki Matsui added to the Padres' woes by striking out the side in the third inning. Despite Jackson Merrill's stunning diving catch, which drew applause from both sides, the Padres were unable to mount a comeback against the relentless Dodgers offense."
